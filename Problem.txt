Challenge
Develop a SPA using Angular that consumes any real time data stream 
(for examples see ***********************************, but you can use anything), 
performs some aggregation of the data and displays the aggregate values on the page.

We encourage using a state management library like ngrx. We ask that you prepare and 
publish this work on GitHub, StackBlitz, or equivalent, viewable to us. Please do not include the name ********** in your project.

An example application would be one that consumes the twitter data stream, filters by a user supplied hash
 tag, and displays average 
number of tweets per minute as well as a sample of the country code of origin.
